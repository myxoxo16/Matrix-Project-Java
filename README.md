# Matrix-Project-Java
This program makes use of a menu option that will allow the user to select the different commands of the program. There are 3 options the user can select through the menu option: 1. The Random Matrix 2. The Transpose Matrix 3. Multiplying 2 Matrices. If the user selects the first option, the method will create a two dimensional array that asks the user to input the number of rows and columns. It will output an array in a proper format and return the file name that is created to the main method. Furthermore, if the user selects option 2, the method first reads an array from the file, then uses it to create transpose. Lastly, if the user selects option 3, the method will create 2 random arrays.
